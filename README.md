This is a simple NextJs project that served mostly as an excercise. Hopefully people will find it helpfull to create simple widgets that measure availability and can be included in sprint reviews.

You can find the project hosted [here](https://availability-widget.vercel.app/)

Feel free to open an PR if you found something that can be improved or changed. I'll try to find the time to implement a couple of the missing features like:

- A current/last sprint widget link to avoid having to update the iframe
- Profile/Team management UI


**Thank you to Joana Costa who help with the UI Design!**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
