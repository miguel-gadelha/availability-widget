This is a simple NextJs project that served mostly as a way to practice. Hopefully people can still find it helpfull to create simple widgets that measure availability and can be included in sprint reviews.

You can find the project hosted [here](https://availability-widget.vercel.app/)

Feel free to open an PR if you found something that can be improved or changed. I'll try to find the time to implement a couple of the missing features like:

- A current/last sprint widget link to avoid having to update the iframe
- Profile/Team management UI


**Thank you to Joana Costa who help with the UI Design!**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
